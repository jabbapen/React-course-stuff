# React-course-stuff
This is stuff I did for an online React+Redux Course (Stephen Grider's on Udemy)

Projects: 
Tutorial - very bare bones code just to learn the basics

Classes - bare bones code to learn class based components

Forms - search bar for unsplash to get familiar with forms in react

Songs - redux practice

Blog posts - more redux practice

youtube-browser - search bar for youtube (note: This uses a google api key for youtube that you need to obtain if you want to use this)

youtube-browser-hooks - same as above but with hooks!

hooks - hooks practice

translate - react context practice

components - a bunch of random components to practice components in react

twitch-clone - allows to stream content from your computer to your web browser. 
  To set up do npm start in every folder then in OBS go to preferences and go to stream. Then set a custom service with a server of "rtmp://localhost:live"   and a stream key of whichever id you want to stream to (IE do 1 if you want the first stream). Then start streaming and check it out in your browser
